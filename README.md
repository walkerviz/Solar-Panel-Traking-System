Solar Panel Traking System

The automated system is efficient, safe, and suitable for research with practical applications. 
It provides a clear view of the automated process. 
However, solar panels are expensive and time-consuming to install, and the model uses lightweight, less durable materials. 
Low voltage from solar panels requires larger panels. 
Future developments include increasing the number of solar panels, reinforcing the structure with stronger materials, using larger servos for better load capacity, creating sensor modules for easier installation, and employing advanced automation technologies like PLC to optimize and reduce production costs.
